# 👋 Hi, I’m Preston | @pvhsl

I'm a Digital Forensics undergrad. My journey began with Lua, then Python for web development, and now I’m deepening my skills in Java. 
I want to learn new programming languages and applying them to real-world projects over time.

**Current Skills:**
- Java
- Powershell

My future goals are into malware analysis, reverse engineering, and data recovery.

**Future Langauges/Unix**

- GoLang
- Bash

When I’m not coding, I’m exploring the world through my camera, it is my way to find peace and inspiration in nature.
