# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Preston | @pvhsl

I'm a Digital Forensics undergrad. My journey began with Lua, then Python for web development, and now Iâ€™m deepening my skills in Java. 
I want to learn new programming languages and applying them to real-world projects over time.

**Current Skills:**
- Java

Eventaully I want to dive into malware analysis, reverse engineering, and data recovery.

I want to learn C++ to experiment with security development in the future.

How so? :
 
- To analyze and reverse engineer malware
- To recover and decrypt lost or maliciously encrypted data

When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m exploring the world through my camera, it is my way to find peace and inspiration in nature.
